/**
 * Mods should use these events to introduce custom rendering during {@link class_761#method_22710}
 * without adding complicated and conflict-prone injections there.  Using these events also enables 3rd-party renderers
 * that make large-scale rendering changes to maintain compatibility by calling any broken event invokers directly.
 *
 * <p>These events can be separated into two categories, the "extraction" events and the "drawing" events,
 * reflecting the respective vanilla phases. All data needed for rendering should be prepared in the "extraction" phase
 * and drawn to the frame buffer during the "drawing" phase. All "extraction" events have the suffix "Extraction".
 * All events without the "Extraction" suffix are "drawing" events. All "drawing" events support OpenGL calls.
 *
 * <p>To attach modded data to vanilla render states, see {@link net.fabricmc.fabric.api.client.rendering.v1.FabricRenderState FabricRenderState}.
 * Only attach the minimum data needed for rendering. Do not attach objects that are not thread-safe such as {@link net.minecraft.class_638}.
